# Operationalize your AKS Cluster

## Introduction and context

In this MicroHack we are going to cover some basic tasks you are facing when running an AKS cluster.

Kubernetes is a technology for container orchestration, enabling efficient deployment, scaling, and management of applications in a cloud environment. It offers benefits like scalability, flexibility across various clouds, high availability, and automated updates. Microsoft Azure's Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) enhances the capabilities of Kubernetes by integrating it seamlessly into the Azure ecosystem, simplifying cluster management and ensuring high security and compliance. With AKS, users get an environment that is not only easy to manage but also cost-effective, as it charges only for the resources used without additional fees for the Kubernetes management infrastructure. This makes AKS a great platform choice for both small and large enterprises seeking to optimize containerized applications with minimal overhead and maximum efficiency.

We will take some insights in fundamental operational tasks like scaling and learn how to observe our cluster with Azure Monitor.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will learn how to setup an AKS, how to handle daily business tasks, monitor operations and resources via Azure Monitor and access your deployments via an ingress controller.
