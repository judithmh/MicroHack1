## Introduction

Kubernetes has emerged as the common standard for sizable and scalable containerized platforms, with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) representing Azure's tailored solution in this realm. In this tutorial, we're going to delve into the essential concepts of AKS, alongside an overview of Kubernetes (K8s) fundamentals. We'll also uncover typical scenarios and operational insights that one may encounter while managing an AKS environment in day-to-day operations.

## Architecture

To have a relateable scenario, we will create a basic AKS cluster setup and use some common services.

## Components

- Azure resource groups are logical containers for Azure resources. You use a single resource group to structure everything related to this solution in the Azure portal.
- Azure Key Vault is a secret store used in Azure to securly manage your keys, certificates and secrets.
- Azure Kubernetes Service is the native approach from Azure for a kubernetes PaaS solution.
- Azure Container Insights is a feature from Azure monitor to simplify monitoring and logging of AKS resources via the Azure Portal.
